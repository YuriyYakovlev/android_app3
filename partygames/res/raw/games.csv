1;Name and Number;As people walk into the party, put their name on one side of an index card, and a number on the other side.$As everyone walks around with their name showing (on the index card that is taped to their shirt), they have to try to introduce themselves to as many people as they can.$After a bit of mingling, tell everyone to turn over his or her name tags, so that the number on each card is showing rather than the name.$Now give everyone a numbered piece of paper, and see who can fill in the most names next to the corresponding number.

Award prizes to those who know their "neighbor."

But if someone falsely accuses you of "stickering" him/her, then you can automatically put one of your stickers on that person.$The first one to get rid of all 10 of their original stickers is the winner!
1;Quick name;Have everyone sit/stand in a circle.$Go around the circle and have everyone say their first name, and then reveal a good way to remember their name.$The first person begins the game by announcing what the category is. For example, let's say that the category is cars. The first person would then throw the ball at someone of his/her choice, and that person would have to say something that relates to the category of cars, as well as the name of the person who threw the ball.$Then as quickly as possible without skipping a beat, that person must throw it to another person of his/her choice.$When the next person gets the ball, he/she must say another thing that relates to the car category as well as the name of the person who just threw the ball- and so on.$If someone flubs a name or a category then he/she is out.

1;Sign my arm;Give all of your guests a marker, and have everyone at the party put a paper bag over their signing hand (arm).$When the host/hostess says, "Go," then everyone in the room must obtain as many signatures as they can.$It isn't as easy as it sounds though, because each person has to keep the paper bag on his or her signing hand (so they must sign with the opposite hand). At the end of 5 minutes, the person with the most signatures is the winner!

Put everyone into pairs, and have them search throughout the house to find as many pieces of ribbon/yarn as they possibly can. They must work with their partner to tie each piece of ribbon/yarn together to create one long piece of yarn/ribbon. Whoever has the longest piece of ribbon/yarn at the end of 10 minutes wins the game (It is OK if not every piece of ribbon is found).
7;Human string relay;First of all, you need to tie a spoon to the end of a ball of yarn. Line up both teams single-file. When the host/hostess says, "Go," the first person from each team must put the spoon down his shirt, as well as his pants. When it comes out of his pant leg, he must then pass it to the next player (As it is still attached to the first player). When it has gone through the entire line, and everyone is attached, then the last person at the end of the line must reverse the process (While the first person winds the string into a ball as it comes back out of each person’s clothing). When the team finishes unwinding the string then the first person in that line needs to shout, "Done!" The team to finish unwinding the string first wins.

There is a person in charge of timing the couples with a stopwatch. When that person says, "Go," the first couple runs to the basket of clothes to get dressed as fast as possible. The woman puts on the men’s clothing, and the man puts on the women’s clothing (over their own clothing). As soon as they are both dressed they have to run to the finish line hand in hand. Each couple goes through the same motions, and the couple with the fastest combined time wins.
7;Name that song;Gather a selection of lyrics together from tunes like, "What’s Love Got To Do With it," "I Will Survive," Heartbreak Hotel," "Love on the Rocks," etc. Do a "dramatic reading," or a dramatic interpretation (also called "Charades") about the song and award prizes to the first person who guesses the correct title of each song.
7;Bag a mate;At some time during the party, separate the men and women. Put the men in one room, and the women in another. Put a large paper bag over each person’s head, and send both sexes back into one room. There is no talking allowed, and each person must "feel around" to find his/her mate. There are no real winners or losers (unless you really grab the wrong mate). Note: When placing bags on the heads of your guests, you have the option to provide eyeholes or not.
7;Give me some sugar;Partners must face each other with their hands tied behind their backs. Blindfold each player, and then put a sugary treat in one partner’s mouth (it could be a snack cake, candy bar, doughnut, etc.).

On the back of the card (or somewhere on the front of the card) write down four words that the person who chooses the card cannot use to describe the name on the card to the other guests. Split into two teams. The other guests have one minute to figure out what the name is without the "chooser" of the word using any of the four words that are not allowed. If the "chooser's" team cannot guess the name then the other team gets one chance to guess the correct name. The team who guesses the most names correctly is the winner. For example: The name is "Al Gore". The four words that cannot be used to describe him are vice-president (ok, so that's 2 words), Tipper, Democrat, and election. So the "chooser" could tell the team that "he is close with Bill Clinton, he works in politics, etc.".

7;True or false;Write the names of each guest at the party on a piece of paper. Next to each name write several different statements that can be true or false. Give each person the paper about an hour into the evening. Next to each statement each guest must either write "true" or "false". The person who answers the most statements correctly wins a prize.

If a person holding a gift is caught crossing her legs, then she must relinquish her gift to the person who catches her crossing her legs. This game should be played for the entire length of the shower.$At the end of the shower, anyone with a gift gets to open it. If a person who already has a gift catches someone with a gift crossing her legs, she can either trade gifts with that person, or choose a person who is "giftless" to give the extra gift to.

8;Word chain;Have all of your guests sit in a circle.$Have one person start the chain by saying one word that describes a wedding.$As you go around the circle, people state their new word, which can be more than one word. And they say the words that were spoken by the people preceding them.

9;A.B.C Birthday;Have all of the kids sit in a circle. Depending on the age of the children, you can either involve the parents or not.

16;Running bases;Set up two “bases” in an area where no one will get hit with errant throws. (How far depends on the skill level of the players.)$Two fielders are on “defense” and toss the ball to each other.$Everyone else is a runner and they try to steal a base while the ball is being thrown.$If they make it to the next base without being tagged out they score a run.$If they are tagged it’s an out.$Three outs and you have to play defense!
16;Poison;Someone stands between two bases. In our backyard we made the "bases" a fence at one end of the yard and a brick wall at the other end of the yard. The player is allowed to move anywhere between those 2 bases.$He is given a ball, and his goal is to try to hit at least one of the people while they are running from base to base.$Obviously, once people are on the base they are "safe." Once he hits someone else with the ball, that person becomes "it."$There is no actual winner of this game, but it is action packed and it can go on for hours until the players get tired.
16;Don't say "football"!;At the beginning of halftime, give your guests small paper footballs to stick onto their chests with double-sided tape.$Tell everyone they're not allowed to say the word "football" while in conversation during halftime.$If a guest hears someone use the word, they can take the football from the offending party.$The person who collects the most footballs is the winner.$You can also play this game where the person who says football has to take a sip from their (alcoholic) drink!
16;Betting squares;Set up a 10x10 grid on the poster board and write one team on the top. The other team is on the side.$Sell each square on the grid for a set amount of money. Play big or small.$Numbers 0-9 are assigned randomly across the rows and down the columns after bets are places and squares are bought. (Draw out of a hat for the order of numbers for each row and column)$The numbers beside each team name represent the last digit in the score for that team. For example, if the score were "AFC team 14- NFC team 3", then whoever's name is in the square under the "4" of the AFC team and the "3" of NFC would win.
16;Pass the cup;Basically the person holding the cup makes the rules. The person holding the cup says, for example, “Touch Down.” Then the cup gets passed and everyone adds a dollar. When there is a touch down the person holding the cup collects the money inside.$You can change up the words to First Down, 50-yard line etc.$A nice idea is to donate the money to a local food bank or charity of your choice.
